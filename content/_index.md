        I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Cho Chun Shik Graduate School of Mobility, KAIST, advised by Prof. Inhi Kim in the [TUPA Lab](https://www.inhi.kim/).

        My research interests include spatiotemporal AI, generative models, and large language models, with applications to autonomous driving and urban mobility. I aim to build models that understand and simulate how people and vehicles move, working toward foundation models for mobility. I am currently also exploring autonomous sensing.

        I received my M.S. from Zhejiang University and worked as a software engineer at Meituan before starting my Ph.D.

        Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration.
